Allow me to introduce myself properly. ðŸ˜Š <br><br> My journey into the world of technology began as a hobby, but it quickly evolved into a full-fledged career path. Pursuing my passion led me to pursue a Master's degree in Business Informatics at Marmara University in Istanbul. It was during this time that I embarked on my professional journey as an ABAP Developer. <br><br> Fast forward to today, and I find myself thriving in the dynamic landscape of software development, now specializing as a Senior UI5 Developer at TGW Logistics in Austria. My role involves crafting innovative Freestyle UI5 Applications that push the boundaries of what's possible. <br><br> With each project and every line of code, I'm fueled by the excitement of creating something meaningful and impactful. I'm always eager to connect with fellow enthusiasts and collaborators who share my dedication to excellence in software development. So, whether you're here out of curiosity or shared interests, I'm thrilled to welcome you to my digital space. Let's embark on this journey together!",
