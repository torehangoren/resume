    <p class="content-color">My journey into the world of technology began as a hobby, but it quickly evolved into a full-fledged career path. Pursuing my passion led me to pursue a Master's degree in Business Informatics at Marmara University in Istanbul.

My role involves crafting innovative Freestyle UI5 Applications that push the boundaries of what's possible. </p>

I'm always eager to connect with fellow enthusiasts and collaborators who share my dedication to excellence in software development. So, whether you're here out of curiosity or shared interests, I'm thrilled to welcome you to my digital space. Let's embark on this journey together! </p>
